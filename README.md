# The Leet Code Repository

Most of my time programming is spent using either Python or MATLAB. Using these languages has left me a little unsure of some of the nuances of programming like memory allocation. I felt like it would be a pretty good idea to try and learn the C programming language.

The idea is to tackle one Leet Code problem per day (starting with Easy, of course), and try and pick up as much as I can about algorithms and data structures in C as possible. All solutions are posted here with a main() function for test cases.
